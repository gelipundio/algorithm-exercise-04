Find the number, but be quick!

Build a function "quick" that sorts a list of numbers

steps:

1. create a new branch
2. ask Felipe @gelipundio to give you access to the repository as collaborator
3. install node modules npm install
4. create a file called solution.js
5. export a function called "quick"
6. code your solution inside "quick" function
7. test your solution with the command `npm run test`
8. once your solution is working fine, push your branch (do not create Pull Request)

Example: you are going to get an input like:
```
  [34, 23, 5, 342, 3, 12, 45]
```

When you run your solution with the input:
```
  find([34, 23, 5, 342, 3, 12, 45])
```

Your solution must return an ordered list
```
  [3, 5, 12, 23, 34, 45, 342] 
```

Constraints:
1. the list is not in order

Rules:
1. you are not allowed to use array.sort()
2. you are not allowed to use array.reduce()

Hints:
1. do you know that bubble sort is slow?
2. do you know that there is a "quick sort"?
